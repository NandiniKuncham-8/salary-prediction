##Salary Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts the salary of an employee based on features such as education level, job title, gender, years of experience, and age.
It uses Python and Scikit-Learn to train a machine learning model and evaluate its performance.

##Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a regression model that can estimate employee salaries from structured input data. The project includes:
Data preprocessing
Handling categorical features
Model training
Model evaluation (RMSE & R² Score)
Saving the trained model

##Technologies Used

Python
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-Learn
Joblib
Jupyter Notebook
